This package is a data-synthesizer that simulates data from Fabry-Perot (FP).  

The Illusion is part of the BTFI software's system called Butterfly, headed by 
Fabricio Ferrari.

New data-reduction packages are being developed by the BTFI Software Team and 
these new packages need to be tested somehow. The ideal would be to have real 
data, but since it would be a real waste of time if we wait until the BTFI 
Instrument is ready and working to get this data, one solution is to create 
"fake" data.

The name "Illusion" came from the idea that we are not creating real images. So,
if it is not a real image, it is an Illusion. And this packaged create illusions 
of FP data. 

This package not only contains methods for populating a whole data-cube with FP 
information but also methods containing several simple operations as input and 
output, visualization, data manipulation and a bit of data reduction.
